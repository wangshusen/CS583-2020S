    "## Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use whatever CNN architecture, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet. However, you must build the networks layer by layer. You must NOT import the archetectures from ```keras.applications```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure ```BatchNormalization``` is between a ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer and an ```activation``` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you want to regularize a ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer, you should place a ```Dropout``` layer **before** the ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. An accuracy above 70% is considered reasonable. An accuracy above 80% is considered good. Without data augmentation, achieving 80% accuracy is difficult.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Keep in mind that you must download it as an IPYNB file and then use IPython Notebook to convert it to HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also keep in mind that the IPYNB and HTML files must contain the outputs. (Otherwise, the instructor will not be able to know the correctness and performance.) Do the followings to keep the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Colab, go to ```Runtime``` --> ```Change runtime type``` --> Do NOT check ```Omit code cell output when saving this notebook```. In this way, the downloaded IPYNB file contains the outputs."
